                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! TheSquad is a personal project I undertook to explore my passion for data analysis 
                    and apply it the gaming community. The goal of this project is to develop a service tool for players of the popular 
                    online multiplayer game, League of Legends, that uses machine learning to recommend what champions to pick during 
                    live games. The first step of which was to develop an API that could retrieve, store, and analyze past match data 
                    about a specified group of players. That has culminated in what you see below!.
            </p>
            <p class="welcome-text">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project was to offload the collection, storage, and management of this data 
                    away from a theoretical "TheSquad" website, similar to sights like "op.gg" or "u.gg" to show of stats. While the data side
                    is complete I plan to use this API to supply data to players in live games, which would continuously analyze the current 
                    of the champ select stage, and actively recommend to each squad member what champion they should pick based on passed data.
                    For now, this API is technically available to the public but has rate limitations and will soon require an API key provided
                    by me!
