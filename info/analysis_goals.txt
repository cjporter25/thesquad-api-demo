******DETERMINING THE BEST PLAYER FOR A CHARACTER ARCHETYPE******
1. Calculate Win Rates and Sample Sizes:
    For each player, note their win rate and the number of games played 
    as the specific character archetype. 
2. Calculate the Standard Error and Confidence Intervals:
    Use the standard error for proportions to calculate the confidence interval for each 
    player's win rate. The standard error for a proportion is given by: 
        ùëÜùê∏ = sqrt[(ùëù(1‚àíùëù))/ùëõ]
    Here, "p" is the win rate and "n" is the number of games.
3. Calculate the Confidence Interval:
    Use a confidence level (typically 95%) to calculate the margin of error and confidence interval.
    The margin of error is:
        ME=Z*SE
    Here, ùëç is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95%). Z-score is
    measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
4. Compare Confidence Intervals:
    The player with the highest [lower bound] of the confidence interval can be considered 
    the most reliable player for that archetype.

******INTERPRETING RESULTS******
1. Script Function:
    Calculate standard error, margin of error, and confidence interval for each player's win rate.
2. Compare:
    Compare the lower bounds of the confidence intervals for each player. IMPORTANT: The player with
    the HIGHEST - Lower Bound of the confidence interval is considered the best statistically. This 
    is because they have the most reliable performance within the calculated confidence level.

******CONFIDENCE LEVEL NOTES******
1. What, in essence is a confidence level?
    - "A measure of how confident you are that a given confidence interval contains the true population 
    parameter" (e.g. the true winrate).
    - It's usually expressed as a percentage and represents....
        - The PROPORTION of confidence intervals that would contain the true parameter if the 
        experiment or sampling was repeated many times.
2. Confidence Level of 90% - Narrow, Less Assurance, More Precise
    - The resulting confidence interval will be narrower. The estimate will be more precise,
    but I have less confidence that the interval contains the true parameter because there's
    a higher chance that the interval does not contain the true parameter
3. Confidence Level of 95% - Standard
    - I am 95% confident that the true parameter lies within the confidence interval. If there 
    were 100 different samples, and each one had a calculated confidence interval, 95 of those
    intervals would contain the true parameter.
4. Confidence Level of 99% - Wide, Greater Assurance, Less Precise
    - The resulting confidence interval will be wider, i.e., to be more confident that a given 
    interval will contain the true parameter, it needs to cover a broader range. Because it's 
    a wider range, I have a higher assurance that the parameter lies within a given interval 
    but the estimate is less precise due to the wider range.


*******WILSON SCORE********
To address the issue with how the "best" player is chosen,
especially in cases where the sample size (number of games played) is vastly different, 
you need a more robust method of comparison that takes both the win rate and the sample 
size into account.

One effective approach is to use the Wilson score interval for estimating the confidence 
interval of the binomial proportion (win rate). The Wilson score interval is particularly 
useful for small sample sizes and provides a more accurate estimate compared to the normal 
approximation.


******SMALL VALUE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL LOWER BOUND *******
A small-valued confidence interval lower bound that is still 
higher than the others indicates that while the player‚Äôs performance (win rate) is not exceptionally 
high, it is statistically more reliable compared to the other players. This can be due to several factors:

Higher Reliability: The player with a small but highest lower bound has more reliable performance,
 meaning their win rate is less variable and more consistent across the games they played.
Sample Size: The number of games played can significantly affect the confidence interval. A player 
who has played more games will have a narrower confidence interval, even if their win rate is not 
the highest. This makes the estimate more reliable.
Statistical Significance: The lower bound of the confidence interval represents a conservative 
    estimate of the player‚Äôs performance. A higher lower bound, even if small, means that we are more 
    confident that the player's true win rate is above this value.
***Interpretation***
Consistent Performance: A player with a higher lower bound of the confidence interval, even if it‚Äôs
    a low value, indicates that their performance is consistently above a certain threshold. This is 
    more reliable than a player with a higher win rate but a lower confidence interval bound.
Risk Assessment: In decision-making, such as choosing which player to use for a specific archetype, 
    a higher lower bound reduces the risk. It suggests that, at worst, the player's performance will 
    be better than the lower bounds of the other players.

Example Scenario:
Consider the confidence intervals for three players with a large range of win rates and sample sizes:

Player A: Win Rate: 0.60, Games: 10, Confidence Interval: [0.30, 0.90]
Player B: Win Rate: 0.55, Games: 200, Confidence Interval: [0.48, 0.62]
Player C: Win Rate: 0.45, Games: 50, Confidence Interval: [0.32, 0.58]
****In this case:

Player A has the highest win rate (0.60), but their confidence interval is very wide ([0.30, 0.90]). 
    This indicates high variability and low reliability due to the small sample size (10 games).
Player B has a slightly lower win rate (0.55) but a much narrower confidence interval ([0.48, 0.62]), 
    Indicating more consistent performance across a larger number of games (200 games).
Player C has the lowest win rate (0.45) and a moderately wide confidence interval ([0.32, 0.58]).
    This reflects moderate reliability with a moderate sample size (50 games).
****Interpretation****
Player A: Despite having the highest win rate, Player A's performance is highly uncertain due to the small 
    sample size. The wide confidence interval suggests that the true win rate could be as low as 0.30 or as high 
    as 0.90, making this player a risky choice.
Player B: This player has a lower win rate but a much narrower confidence interval, indicating that their 
    performance is consistent and reliable. The lower bound of 0.48 means that we are 95% confident that the true 
    win rate is at least 0.48, which is relatively high and reliable.
Player C: Player C has the lowest win rate and a moderately wide confidence interval, indicating less reliable 
    performance. The lower bound of 0.32 is lower than that of Player B, making Player C a less preferable choice.
Conclusion:
    Best Choice: Player B is the best choice due to their high lower bound (0.48) of the confidence interval, 
    despite not having the highest win rate. This indicates more consistent and reliable performance.
    Risky Choice: Player A is a risky choice due to the high variability in their performance, as indicated 
    by the wide confidence interval.
    Moderate Choice: Player C is a moderate choice, but with a lower reliability compared to Player B.
    Player A:  Win Rate = 0.60,  Confidence Interval = [0.30, 0.90]
                 |------------|-------------|
    Player B:  Win Rate = 0.55,  Confidence Interval = [0.48, 0.62]
                   |----|-----|
    Player C:  Win Rate = 0.45,  Confidence Interval = [0.32, 0.58]
                 |-------|------|   

Example Scenario 2:
Player A: Win Rate: 0.75, Games: 10, Wilson Score Interval: [0.45, 0.92] 
Player B: Win Rate: 0.60, Games: 200, Wilson Score Interval: [0.53, 0.66]
Player C:Win Rate: 0.40, Games: 50, Wilson Score Interval: [0.28, 0.53] 
Player D:Win Rate: 0.90, Games: 5, Wilson Score Interval: [0.41, 0.99] 
Player E:Win Rate: 0.50, Games: 150, Wilson Score Interval: [0.42, 0.58] 

Given these intervals, we can see:
Player A has a high win rate but also high variability due to the small sample size.
Player B has a moderate win rate with high reliability due to the large sample size.
Player C has a lower win rate and moderate variability.
Player D has a very high win rate but extremely high variability due to the very small sample size.
Player E has a moderate win rate with decent reliability due to a relatively large sample size.
In this exaggerated example, Player B might be considered the best player despite not having the 
highest win rate because their performance is the most reliable, as indicated by the highest lower 
bound of the Wilson score interval. This highlights the importance of considering both win rate and 
sample size when evaluating player performance.






Wilson Score Interval
Purpose: Measures the confidence interval for a player's win rate, providing an estimate of where 
the true win rate lies based on the number of games played.
Usage: Helps identify the reliability and consistency of a player's performance.
Adjusted Win Rate
Purpose: Adjusts the player's win rate by comparing it to the squad's overall win rate.
Usage: Highlights whether a player is performing above or below the squad average, providing 
a relative performance measure.
Player Contribution
Purpose: Calculates the player's contribution to the squad's overall performance based on the 
number of games played.
Usage: Provides insight into the impact of the player's performance on the squad's success.
Significance Testing (p-value)
Purpose: Determines if the player's win rate is statistically significantly different from the 
squad's overall win rate.
Usage: Helps identify if the player's performance is an outlier or within the expected range.

Wilson Score Interval
Purpose: Provides a confidence interval for the player's win rate.
Interpretation:
Lower Bound: Represents the minimum win rate we can expect with a high degree of confidence.
Higher Lower Bound: Indicates more reliable and consistent performance.
Example: If a player has a Wilson score interval of [0.45, 0.70], we are confident that their true win 
rate is at least 45%.
Adjusted Win Rate
Purpose: Compares the player's win rate to the squad's overall win rate.
Interpretation:
Positive Adjusted Win Rate: Indicates the player performs better than the squad average.
Negative Adjusted Win Rate: Indicates the player performs worse than the squad average.
Example: If the squad win rate is 0.52 and a player's win rate is 0.60, the adjusted win rate 
is 0.08 (0.60 - 0.52), meaning the player performs 8% better than the squad average.
Player Contribution
Purpose: Measures the player's contribution to the squad's overall performance based on their win
 rate and number of games played.
Interpretation:
Higher Contribution: Indicates a more significant impact on the squad's success.
Example: If a player has a win rate of 0.60 and has played 50 games out of the squad's total 384 games, 
their contribution is (0.60 * 50) / 384 = 0.0781, meaning they contribute approximately 7.81% to 
the squad's performance.
Significance Testing (p-value)
Purpose: Determines if the player's win rate is significantly different from the squad's 
overall win rate.
Interpretation:
Low p-value (< 0.05): Indicates the difference is statistically significant.
High p-value (> 0.05): Indicates the difference is not statistically significant.
Example: A p-value of 0.03 means there is a statistically significant difference between the 
player's win rate and the squad's win rate.
Combined Interpretation
By analyzing these metrics together, you can get a holistic view of each player's performance:

Reliability and Consistency:

A high lower bound in the Wilson score interval suggests the player's performance is reliable 
and consistent.
Relative Performance:

A positive adjusted win rate indicates the player is performing above the squad average, 
providing additional value.
A negative adjusted win rate suggests room for improvement relative to the squad's average.
Impact on Squad:

High player contribution values indicate significant impact on the squad's success.
Low contribution values may suggest less influence, even if the player has a good win rate, 
especially if they played fewer games.
Statistical Significance:

A low p-value indicates that the player's performance is statistically different from the 
squad's average, highlighting exceptional performance (either positive or negative).
